# CISA Emergency Directives

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) periodically issues “[Emergency Directives](https://cyber.dhs.gov/directives/),” which require action on the part of federal agencies.
As a FedRAMP-authorized service, cloud.gov takes the following actions to notify our customers of our response to CISA directives, or other emergency inquires from FedRAMP.

1. Updates a central directory of Emergency Directive responses (this page)
2. Notifies customers and stake holders via our public status service: https://cloudgov.statuspage.io
    * We post as a "Resolved Incident" that impacts "Applications" (operational), ensure "Send Notification"

This assumes cloud.gov is not impacted by the directive. Otherwise cloud.gov posts as an "Open incident", if warranted, and follows our established [incident response plan]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/ops/security-ir/), as informed by the Emergency Directive and the [FedRAMP Incident Communications Procedures](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/CSP_Incident_Communications_Procedures.pdf).

cloud.gov confirms that it has zero affected endpoints in the FedRAMP authorized boundary, and hence has 100% patch compliance.

Further, cloud.gov has zero affected endpoints under our management outside the boundary, e.g. in development or test environments.

We want to assure cloud.gov agency customers that their systems, and our product, have no exposure to this particular vulnerability.
