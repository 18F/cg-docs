The continued development of cloud.gov is in direct support of the Cloud Smart initiative. Cloud Smart is a long-term, high-level strategy to drive cloud adoption in government agencies developed by the [Chief Information Officers Council (CIO) Council](https://www.cio.gov/about/vision/). The goal of this strategy is to achieve additional savings, security, as well as delivering faster services - all benefits offered by cloud.gov.



Cloud Smart focuses on driving cloud adoption through building knowledge in government and removing bottlenecks. This initiative strives to equip agencies with the tools, knowledge, and resources required to move to the cloud according to their agency needs.



On the technology provider side, the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) was put in place to set a standard for security assessment and authorization, as well as continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. The rise of data breaches has reiterated the need for government agencies to partner with FedRAMP certified vendors whose products and services can be trusted to store and transmit sensitive government workloads.

cloud.gov is a secure and compliant technology provider that helps federal agencies deliver the services the public deserves in a faster, more user-centered way. cloud.gov is FedRAMP certified, and has undergone a significant, thorough security and compliance review so that your agency can focus on reviewing the parts of the system that serve your mission more directly.
