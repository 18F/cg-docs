## Creating users

Follow the instructions for [the `provision-user-space` CLI plugin](https://github.com/18F/cf-provision-user-space-plugin).

### Additional access

You can grant the user access to additional organizations and spaces by giving them additional roles. Read more in [the community Cloud Foundry documentation](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/roles.html#roles).
