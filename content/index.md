# Cloud.gov Documentation

Cloud Foundry is an open source Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) system for managing the deployment of apps, services, and background tasks. 18F uses a customized government-tuned deployment of Cloud Foundry to host many of our development and production systems. 18F offers access to this service for other government agencies via a closed pilot under cloud.gov, which we expect to expand in future.
