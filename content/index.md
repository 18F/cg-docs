# Cloud.gov Cloud Foundry Documentation

Welcome! Cloud Foundry is an open source Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) system for managing the deployment of apps, services, and background tasks. 18F is starting to use it for many of our development and production systems.

## Help!

Find the section you need on the left. Reach out in [#cloud-gov-support](https://18f.slack.com/messages/cloud-gov-support/) or [open an issue](https://github.com/18F/cloud-foundry-notes/issues/new) if you need anything. If you're not part of 18F but want to talk with us about fun DevOps stuff, [join our #devops-public Slack channel](https://chat.18f.gov/).
