title: Grouping unrelated apps
weight: 40

Right now, the only thing that stops an agency from grouping together unrelated applications and services is honor in abiding by our guideline: “No clown cars.”

We will be refining the definition of “clown car” in the future by observing common usage patterns and identifying what a reasonable count of apps-per-space and spaces-per-org looks like. Once we’ve stated a concrete definition, we’ll give a grace-period warning for any violations we observe. After that grace period, we will take action. For now, please don’t abuse the “no clown cars” guideline so we can spend less time policing abusers, and more time making the service better.
