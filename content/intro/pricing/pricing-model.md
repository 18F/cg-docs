## Pricing model

18F provides its services to other agencies on a cost-recovery model. This holds not only for cloud.gov, but also for consulting, delivery, and other work. The initial funding for cloud.gov came from a grant from the Acquisition Services Fund. We also recover some of the costs by charging for labor on digital products we deliver for agency partners.

The current cloud.gov pricing model has four components:

- Access package
- Resource usage
- Managed services
- Ã€ la carte items

Find out more about each component via our [pricing terminology page]({{< relref "intro/terminology/pricing-terminology.md" >}}) or see the [dedicated page with our rates]({{< relref "intro/pricing/rates.md" >}}).

**The current model is provisional.** In the agile tradition, we are validating whether this model fits the needs of federal agencies, which often face issues around budget or appropriation categories for the money they spend on a particular purchase or service. The current model is also a test to validate that providing cloud.gov to other agencies will be cost-recoverable for 18F and GSA. The pricing model must cover the costs of developing, providing, and supporting it for other agencies, rather than just 18F's internal use.

This model may change significantly in future, depending on what the take-up of cloud.gov across agencies looks like, and whether this capability ends up being considered critical for the government as a whole.
