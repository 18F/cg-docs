For terminology that is used within the platform-as-a-service at the heart of cloud.gov, start with [Cloud Foundryâ€™s glossary](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/glossary.html).

We are defining other terms related to cloud.gov in this Terminology section. We will add additional terms if confusion about them comes up frequently in questions from partner agencies or the public.
