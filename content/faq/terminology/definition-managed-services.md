A “managed service” is a commodity service (databases, caches, etc.) that cloud.gov provisions and runs on behalf of tenant applications. These services reduce the ops responsibility for the application team. Managed services can be spun up and down on demand. In some cases alternative “plans” can be selected for resilience, performance, or cost trade-offs.
