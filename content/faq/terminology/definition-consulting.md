“Consulting” is advice, development, documentation, etc. that is custom or specific the context of your application, system, or organization. If the outcome of the activity will not be reusable for our entire community of users, it’s consulting. Base platform feeds do not include consulting, and we do not offer consulting outside of projects directly undertaken by 18F for delivery or consulting on behalf of a partner agency.
