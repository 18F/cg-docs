If you plan to perform a penetration test on your customer applications, please send the following information to [cloud.gov support](/help/) at least a week ahead of your planned test.

```text
* Source IPs (for testers and their tools): 
* Start date:  
* End date: 
* Estimated bandwidth: 
```

This will enable us to submit a [penetration test authorization request to Amazon Web Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/pen-testing.html) on your behalf.
