title: Penetration test authorization
---

If you plan to perform a penetration test on your customer applications, please send the following information to [cloud.gov support](/help/) at least a week ahead of your planned test:

```text
* Source IPs (for testers and their tools): 
* Start date:  
* End date: 
* Estimated bandwidth: 
```

This request is only necessary for in-depth security testing, which is a common step in agency ATO processes for customer systems. You don't need to wait for an approval; simply sending the notification is sufficient. You can always run routine vulnerability scans on your own applications without special authorization.
