title: Penetration test authorization
---

If you plan to perform a penetration test on your customer applications, please send the following information to [cloud.gov support](/help/) ahead of your planned test:

```text
* Source IPs (for testers and their tools): 
* Start date:  
* End date: 
```

This request is only necessary for in-depth security testing, which is a common step in agency ATO processes for customer systems. You don't need to wait for an approval; simply sending the notification is sufficient. You can always run routine automated vulnerability scans on your own applications without special authorization.

When arranging a security assessment or penetration test, the system under test is _your_ application at _application-name_.app.cloud.gov, not the cloud.gov infrastructure -- as cloud.gov tests those continually and [makes the results available through FedRAMP](https://cloud.gov/docs/security/fedramp-tracker/#start-the-ato-process). Your assessment must not target other cloud.gov customers, nor perform or simulate denial of service attacks; a restriction we inherit from the [Amazon AWS testing policy](https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/).
