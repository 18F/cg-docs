cloud.gov supports applications written in Go, Java, Node.js, .NET Core, PHP, Python, and Ruby. cloud.gov also supports applications that rely on a static binary that uses the 64-bit Linux kernel ABI, or that consist of static HTML, CSS, and Javascript assets.

cloud.gov does _not_ support applications that use .NET Framework, or application binaries that require access to Microsoft Windows kernel or system APIs.

For documentation on deploying applications using common languages and web frameworks to cloud.gov, see the [Cloud Foundry buildpack documentation](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/) and [Cloud Foundry sample applications](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples).
