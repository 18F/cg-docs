cloud.gov supports applications written in Go, Java, Node.js, .NET Core, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Apps can also be deployed which rely on a static binary that uses the 64-bit Linux kernel ABI, or consist of static HTML, CSS, and Javascript assets.

cloud.gov does _not_ support .NET Framework applications or binaries that require access to Microsoft Windows kernel or system APIs.

For documentation on deploying applications using common languages and web frameworks to cloud.gov, see the [Cloud Foundry buildpack documentation](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/) or [Cloud Foundry sample applications](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples).
