title: Single sign-on integration
---

If your agency has an identity provider that supports SAML single sign-on, such as Active Directory Federation Service (ADFS) or SecureAuth, you can integrate your identity provider with cloud.gov so that users from your agency can authenticate to cloud.gov using your agency provider. 

To integrate your identity provider with cloud.gov, you'll need to exchange SAML metadata with us. This is a straightforward process, but it isn't self-service. You can set up a meeting between a cloud.gov engineer and your identity provider administrator by [contacting support](/help/).
