[**This is an experimental feature.**]({{< relref "docs/apps/experimental/experimental.md" >}})

_Note: As of March 2018, this feature is not yet available, pending FedRAMP approval. If you want to use this feature, [contact support](({{< relref "docs/help.md" >}})) and our team will let you know our estimated timeline for approval._

cloud.gov uses a range of [security features](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/container-security.html) to prevent application containers from interfering with other containers or with the hosts they run on. As an additional security measure, cloud.gov also monitors application containers for suspicous behavior using [Sysdig Falco](https://sysdig.com/opensource/falco/).

## What counts as suspicous behavior?

We are using [the default Falco ruleset](https://github.com/draios/falco/blob/dev/rules/falco_rules.yaml). We will add to our ruleset over time, particularly to flag [behavior which is not compatible with the existing container security restrictions](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/container-security.html#hardening).

## What action will be taken when suspicious behavior is observed?

cloud.gov will append a log entry associated with the application that describes what was observed. For example, an attempt to create a directory within a protected path like `/bin` will result in a log entry like this:

```
2018-03-22T09:36:17.13-0400 [FALCO/0] ERR 13:36:17.084775186: Error Directory below known binary directory created (user=<NA> command=mkdir -p /bin/hack directory=/bin/hack) (pid=<redacted>, ppid=<redacted>) (pid=<redacted>, ppid=<redacted>)
```

You can view logs generated by this feature just like any other application logs, using `cf logs` or at https://logs.fr.cloud.gov. 

We plan to restart applications that are flagged for particularly suspicious behavior to reset them to their original state and deny a foothold to attackers. This will not affect your application's availability so long as you have more than one instance running.

## How should we respond to log entries about suspicious behavior?

During development, you should diagnose the source of the behavior and removing it from your application will prevent noise from false-positives in your logs. (We will investigate how we can enable you to explicitly suppress logs about behavior that is expected.)

For production deployments, you should configure alerts based on logs like this, which then trigger close examination of preceding logs from your application for any signs of intrusion. Doing this may help you fulfill the requirements of [RA-5](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/RA-5), [SI-3](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/SI-3), and [AU-6](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/AU-6) when seeking an ATO for your application from your agency Authorizing Official.
