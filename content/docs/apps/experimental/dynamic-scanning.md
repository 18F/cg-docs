[**This is an experimental feature.**]({{< relref "docs/apps/experimental/experimental.md" >}})

_Note: As of March 2018, this feature is not yet available, pending FedRAMP approval. If you want to use this feature, create a ticket and our team will let you know our estimated timeline for approval._

Cloud Foundry includes a range of [security features](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/container-security.html) to prevent application containers from interfering with other containers or with the hosts they run on. As an additional security measure, cloud.gov also monitors application containers for anomalous behavior using [Sysdig Falco](https://sysdig.com/opensource/falco/). If an application container exhibits unexpected behavior (for example, attempt to create a directory within a protected path like `/bin`), Falco will emit a log associated with the appliation:

```
2018-03-22T09:36:17.13-0400 [FALCO/0] ERR 13:36:17.084775186: Error Directory below known binary directory created (user=<NA> command=mkdir -p /bin/hack directory=/bin/hack) (pid=<redacted>, ppid=<redacted>) (pid=<redacted>, ppid=<redacted>)
```

You can view logs generated by Falco like any other application logs, using `cf logs` or at logs.fr.cloud.gov.
