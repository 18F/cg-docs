Setting up continuous deployment allows you to automatically upload your
changes to your desired environment.

## Get ready

Before setting up continuous deployment:

1. Go through the [production-ready guide]({{< relref "production-ready.md" >}}) to ensure your application uses the [core best practices]({{< relref "production-ready.md#core-best-practices" >}}) and [zero-downtime deployment]({{< relref "production-ready.md#zero-downtime-deploy" >}}). This will help you use continuous deployment with reduced risk of errors and outages.
 * The essential requirements: your code needs to be in version control, and it needs to include [a `manifest.yml` file](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html) that captures the intended deployment configuration for your application.
1. Set up continuous integration. This will protect you from deploying a broken application. You can use the same service for continuous integration and continuous deployment â€” see [the list of continuous integration services below]({{< relref "#configure-your-service" >}}) for suggestions.

## Provision deployment credentials

Continuous deployment systems require credentials for use in pushing new versions of your application code to cloud.gov. You should use a restricted set of credentials that can only access a particular target space, rather than credentials tied to a user who has more access, or who may lose access when leaving your team or project. This "least privilege" approach minimizes the harm that is possible if the credentials are compromised in any way.

To provision a deployer account with permission to deploy to a single space, [set up an instance of a cloud.gov service account]({{< relref "docs/services/cloud-gov-service-account.md" >}}).

## Configure your service

cloud.gov does not yet provide a CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous deployment) service, but you can use any CI/CD service of your choice.

You can configure your code repositories, [spaces]({{< relref "docs/getting-started/concepts.md#spaces" >}}), and CI/CD service together to enable automated or semi-automated deployments to your environments (such as development, staging, and production environments). For deployments in each environment, you can configure access control and testing requirements according to your project's needs.

To illustrate how a CI/CD workflow could be incorporated with cloud.gov:

subgraph cloud.gov
  subgraph Org
  subgraph Dev space
      Dev[App]
    end
    subgraph Staging space
      Staging[App]
    end
    subgraph Production space
      Prod[App]
    end
  end
end

## Service examples

Here are examples of how to set up two cloud-based services that have free tiers for open source projects, [Travis](https://docs.travis-ci.com/) and [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/docs/1.0/). (You can also find and adapt instructions for using other CI/CD services with other Cloud Foundry deployments, such as [this explanation of how to use Jenkins](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/#setting-up-the-cloud-foundry-jenkins-plugin).)

### Travis

See [the Travis documentation](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/cloudfoundry/).

Use `api: https://api.fr.cloud.gov`

You must encrypt the password, and you must [**escape any symbol characters in the password**](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encryption-keys#Note-on-escaping-certain-symbols), to prevent possible situations where Travis could dump an error message that contains passwords or environment variables.

For more information about configuring Travis, see [Customizing the Build](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/).

#### Using Conditional Deployments with Travis

A common pattern for team workflows is to use separate development and master branches, along with using a staging or QA deployment with the development branch, and a production deployment with the master branch. This can be achieved in Travis with [`on:`](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment#Conditional-Releases-with-on%3A) to specify a branch, and using unique manifests for each deployment.

```yaml
deploy:
- manifest: manifest-staging.yml
  # ...
  on:
    branch: develop
- manifest: manifest.yml
  # ...
  on:
    branch: master
```

Each manifest should at the very least define an unique `name`, but can also define an unique `host`. Also, it may be necessary to define unique services for each application to use. See [Cloning Applications]({{< relref "cloning.md" >}}) for more information.

#### Jekyll with Travis

To deploy a Jekyll site, add the following to your `.travis.yml`:

```yaml
language: ruby
rvm:
- 2.1
script: jekyll build ./_site
deploy:
  skip_cleanup: true
  # ...
```

For details, see [Jekyll's Continuous Integration guide](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/).


### CircleCI

See [Getting Started with CircleCI](https://circleci.com/docs/1.0/getting-started/) -- you'll need to set up a CircleCI account and give it access to your code repository.

In your code repository, use the following template to set up your `circle.yml` file. This uses CircleCI 1.0 syntax.

```yaml
dependencies:
  pre:
    - curl -v -L -o cf-cli_amd64.deb 'https://cli.run.pivotal.io/stable?release=debian64&source=github'
    - sudo dpkg -i cf-cli_amd64.deb
    - cf -v

test:
  post:
    - cf login -a https://api.fr.cloud.gov -u DEPLOYER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_USERNAME -p $CF_PASS -o ORG -s SPACE

deployment:
  production:
    branch: master
    commands:
      - cf push
```

Replace `DEPLOYER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_USERNAME`, `ORG`, and `SPACE` with your information. **Do not replace** `$CF_PASS` with your deployer service account password -- instead, export the `CF_PASS` environment variable [in the CircleCI interface](https://circleci.com/docs/1.0/environment-variables/#setting-environment-variables-for-all-commands-without-adding-them-to-git) and put the deployer password there.

You can also review their [sample circle.yml file](https://circleci.com/docs/1.0/config-sample/) for more configuration options.

**Note**: If your `manifest.yml` describes more than one app, you might want to specify which app to push in the `cf push` line.
