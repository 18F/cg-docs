title: Ongoing platform maintenance
---

The platform requires regular support and maintenance activities to remain in a 
compliant state. If you are on support and you canâ€™t complete any of the items 
personally, you are responsible for ensuring that an appropriate person does it.
If you haven't already reached out on Slack, reach out during standup to get
visibility with the people who might best help.

# Is it your first day of support?

- Update the [`#cg-platform`](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/cg-platform/) 
topic to include your name as the support contact.
- Update the support schedule by moving yourself to the end of the list in the 
[slackbot auto response](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/customize/slackbot) for 
`atlas support schedule`.
- Join/unmute [`#cg-support`](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/cg-support/) 
and [`#cg-platform-news`](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/cg-platform-news/)
- Meet with the previous support person and take responsibility for any open 
support items they are still working on. There is a standing support sync meeting 
(Tuesday 4:30-5 pm ET) that you should join if you are rolling on or off support
that week.

# Daily maintenance checklist

The tasks on this checklist should be performed each day.

## PR as you go

If you see a way to make this checklist better, just submit a PR to the 
[cg-site](https://github.com/18F/cg-site) repo.

## Ensure all VMs are running the current stemcell

- Get the latest stemcell version from http://bosh.cloudfoundry.org/stemcells/.

- Check https://ci.fr.cloud.gov/teams/main/pipelines/aws-light-stemcell-builder 
to ensure it has built the same version.

- On each bosh director run `bosh deployments` and verify the stemcell in-use 
for each deployment is current.

- **Note:** The 
[nessus manager deployment](https://github.com/18F/cg-deploy-nessus-manager) 
requires that the System Owner reset the license key after a stemcell upgrade. 
Coordinate with the System Owner to ensure the key is ready to be reset before 
deploying an update that will upgrade the stemcell.

## Review and respond to open alerts

Review all recent alerts and notifications delivered to [`cg-notifications`](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forum/#!forum/cloud-gov-notifications) 
and [`#cg-platform-news`](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/cg-platform-news/).

### Are there no alerts or notifications?
Verify the monitoring system is functioning correctly and confirm that alerts 
are reaching their expected destinations.

### Is the alert a real issue?
Remediate it.

### Is the alert a false-positive?
If the alert can be tuned to reduce the number of false-positives with less than 
one day's work, do it.  If more work is required to tune the alert, add a card 
to capture the work that needs to be done or +1 an existing card if one already 
exists for tuning the alert.

Be prepared to represent support needs at the next grooming meeting to ensure 
that cards to fix alerts are prioritized properly.

## Review AWS CloudTrail events

Use the [AWS Console](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/govcloud-console.html) 
to [review API activity history](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events-console.html) 
for the following events:

- AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress
- AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress
- ConsoleLogin
- CreatePolicy
- CreateSecurityGroup
- DeleteTrail
- ModifyVpcAttribute
- PutUserPolicy
- PutRolePolicy
- RevokeSecurityGroupEgress
- RevokeSecurityGroupIngress
- UpdateTrail

If you observe any non-Terraform activity, discuss the event(s) with the 
indicated [cloud.gov operator(s)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mW3tphZ98ExmMxLHPogSpTq8DzYr5Oh8_SHnOTvjRWM/edit) 
and if necessary follow the 
[Security Incident Response Guide]({{< relref "docs/ops/security-ir.md" >}}).

## Review vulnerability and compliance reports
- [Nessus Vulnerability Reports](https://nessus.fr.cloud.gov/)
- [Nessus Compliance Reports](https://nessus.fr.cloud.gov/)
- [CloudFoundry Alerts](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/category/security/)
- [US Cert Alerts](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts)

If the reports contain any HIGH items work to remediate them.

### Is an update from our IaaS provider required to remediate?
Open a case with the IaaS provider and monitor the case until it has been 
resolved.

### Is a stemcell update required to remediate?
Ask for a date when new stemcells will be delivered in #security in the 
[CF Slack](https://cloudfoundry.slack.com/).

### Is a bosh release update required to remediate?
Update the bosh release and file a PR for the changes.  Once the PR is merged, 
ensure the updated release is deployed to all required VMs.

## Review open support requests

Review the "new" (yellow) and "open" (red) Zendesk tickets. First-tier support 
(customer squad) has primary responsibility to do the work of answering these, and 
you serve as second-tier support providing technical expertise. You're welcome 
to reply to the customer with answers if you like (choose "pending" when you 
submit the answer)*, but your main responsibility is to provide technical 
diagnoses/advice/details. The easiest way to do that is to write comments on the 
associated posts in 
[`#cg-supportstream`](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/cg-supportstream). 
First-tier support may also ask you for pairing time to work out responses 
together.

* People with @gsa.gov emails can't receive email via Zendesk, so we have to 
email them via the [cloud-gov-support Google Group instead](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forum/#!forum/cloud-gov-support).
