cloud.gov offers two [Redis](http://www.redis.io/) services: a single-instance Redis 2.8 service and a highly-available multi-instance [Sentinel](https://www.redis.io/topics/sentinel/) and Redis 3.2.10 service.

## Plans

<h3 id="redis32">Redis 3.2</h3>

Service Name | Plan Name | Description | Price
------------ | --------- | ----------- | -----
`redis32` | `standard-ha` | Redis instance with several GB storage | Free in Beta

#### How to create an instance

To create a service instance, run the following command (replace `my-redis-service` with a name for the service):

```sh
cf create-service redis32 standard-ha my-redis-service
```

**This service is still in Beta mode**

The `standard-ha` plan is highly-available in particular around redundancy,
three Redis Servers sized similarly to the `standard` plan, and availability,
the server is available within a 500 millisecond window during a Redis server
failover. We are offering it in **beta** to test this plan under production
load. If you have feedback about this service, please don't hesitate to
[contact us](mailto:cloud-gov-support@gsa.gov).

<h3 id="redis28">Redis 2.8</h3>

Service Name | Plan Name | Description | Price
------------ | --------- | ----------- | -----
`redis28` | `standard` | Redis instance with several GB storage | Free in Alpha

#### How to create an instance

To create a service instance, run the following command (replace `my-redis-service` with a name for the service):

```sh
cf create-service redis28 standard my-redis-service
```

**This service is still in Alpha mode**: downtime and data loss is possible.

## Rotating credentials

You can rotate credentials by creating a new instance and deleting the existing instance. If this is not an option, email [cloud.gov support](mailto:cloud-gov-support@gsa.gov) to request rotating the credentials manually.

## Managing backups

The Redis service does not expose access to files generated by the Redis [SAVE](https://redis.io/commands/save) command. To back up data from your Redis instance, you can iterate over keys, fetch their values and expiration times using [DUMP](https://redis.io/commands/dump) and [TTL](https://redis.io/commands/ttl), and save them to a file. To restore, use the [RESTORE](https://redis.io/commands/restore) command for each saved key.
