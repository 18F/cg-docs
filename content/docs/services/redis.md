cloud.gov offers [Redis](http://www.redis.io/) 2.8 and 3.2 as a service.

## Plans

Service Name | Plan Name | Description | Price
------------ | --------- | ----------- | -----
`redis28` | `standard` | Redis instance with 10 GB storage | Free in Beta
`redis32` | `standard-ha` | Redis instance with 10 GB storage | Free in Beta

**Note:** The `standard-ha` plan runs multiple Redis instances on different machines, so that service is not interrupted by routine platform maintenance. The `standard` plan runs a single instance and will be briefly unavailable during platform maintenance; this plan should not be used for production applications.

#### How to create an instance

To create a service instance, run the following command (replace `my-redis-service` with a name for the service):

```sh
cf create-service redis32 standard-ha my-redis-service
```

## HA client configuration

During platform maintenance each Redis instance in the cluster will be temporarily removed while it is being updated.  All clients connected to the instance will be disconnected during this process.

To ensure your application stays up during this process, configure your client to use a short (~ 1 second) timeout and to automatically reconnect to Redis when disconnected.


## Rotating credentials

You can rotate credentials by creating a new instance and deleting the existing instance. If this is not an option, email [cloud.gov support](mailto:cloud-gov-support@gsa.gov) to request rotating the credentials manually.

## Managing backups

The Redis service does not expose access to files generated by the Redis [SAVE](https://redis.io/commands/save) command. To back up data from your Redis instance, you can iterate over keys, fetch their values and expiration times using [DUMP](https://redis.io/commands/dump) and [TTL](https://redis.io/commands/ttl), and save them to a file. To restore, use the [RESTORE](https://redis.io/commands/restore) command for each saved key.
