status: "Alpha"
---

cloud.gov offers [Redis](https://www.redis.io/) 2.8 as a service. **This service is still in Alpha mode**: downtime and data loss is possible.

## Plans

Plan Name | Description | Price
--------- | ----------- | -----
`standard` | Redis instance with several GB storage | Free in Alpha

## How to create an instance

To create a service instance run the following command:

```sh
cf create-service redis28 standard my-redis-service
```

### Rotating credentials

You can rotate credentials by creating a new instance and deleting the existing instance. If this is not an option, email [cloud.gov support](mailto:cloud-gov-support@gsa.gov) to request rotating the credentials manually.

### Managing backups

The Redis service does not expose access to files generated by the Redis [SAVE](https://redis.io/commands/save) command. To back up data from your Redis instance, you can iterate over keys, fetch their values and expiration times using [DUMP](https://redis.io/commands/dump) and [TTL](https://redis.io/commands/ttl), and save them to a file. To restore, use the [RESTORE](https://redis.io/commands/restore) command for each saved key.

### The broker in GitHub
