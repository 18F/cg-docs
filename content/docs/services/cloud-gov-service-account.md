To set up your application to be deployed with an automated system, you need a deployer account that has access to push your application.

## Plans

Plan Name | Description | Price
--------- | ----------- | -----
`space-deployer` | A service account for continuous deployment, limited to a single space | Free
`space-auditor` | A service account for auditing configuration and monitoring events limited to a single space | Free

Note: As of July 7, 2017, the instructions for obtaining credentials have changed. If you created a service account instance before this date, see [this post for changes]({{< relref "updates/2017-07-05-changes-to-credentials-broker.md" >}}).

## How to create an instance

To create a service instance that can provision service accounts, run the following command:

```bash
cf create-service cloud-gov-service-account space-deployer my-service-account
```

If your service account only requires read access and does not need the ability to deploy applications, use the `space-auditor` plan instead:

```bash
cf create-service cloud-gov-service-account space-auditor my-service-account
```

## Obtaining credentials

To create a service account, bind a [service key](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/service-keys.html) to the service instance:

```bash
cf create-service-key my-service-account my-service-key
cf service-key my-service-account my-service-key
```

This will create a cloud.gov service account and make the credentials available to you via a service key. Keep these credentials secure. If theyâ€™re compromised, the way to invalidate the credentials is to delete the service key (you can create another, and it will have a fresh set of credentials). Each service key that you bind to your instance creates a separate service account with different credentials; you can create as many service keys per instance as you like. <!-- this advice should match on /docs/services/cloud-gov-service-account/ + /docs/services/cloud-gov-identity-provider/ -->

After you create one of these service keys, you will see a new "user" in your org and space with a name made of 36 letters, numbers, and dashes as its unique identifier, similar to `f6ab4cfb-6e6c-4b10-8585-3f39e740905c`. In your event logs, its actions will display as actions by `service-account@cloud.gov`.

These credentials can be used with the `cf login` command in automated deployment scripts.
