To set up your application to be deployed with an automated system, you need a deployer account that has access to push your application.

## Plans

Plan Name | Description | Price
--------- | ----------- | -----
`space-deployer` | A service account for continuous deployment, limited to a single space | Free
`space-auditor` | A service account for auditing configuration and monitoring events limited to a single space | Free

## How to create an instance

After you create one of these service instances, you will see a new "user" in your org and space with a name made of 36 letters, numbers, and dashes as its unique identifier, similar to `f6ab4cfb-6e6c-4b10-8585-3f39e740905c`. In your event logs, its actions will display as actions by `service-account@cloud.gov`.

To create a service instance that can deploy applications, run the following command:

```sh
cf create-service cloud-gov-service-account space-deployer <SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME>
```

If your service account only requires read access and does not need the ability to deploy applications, use the `space-auditor` plan instead:

```sh
cf create-service cloud-gov-service-account space-auditor <SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME>
```

## Obtaining credentials

Once you've created the service instance, you'll want to obtain the username and password from it:

```sh
cf service <SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME>
```

This will display a link to a page on [Toaster](https://fugacious.18f.gov/) (Fugacious) which contains your credentials. Be sure to retrieve your credentials right away, since the link will only work for a brief length of time. Keep these credentials secure. If theyâ€™re compromised, the way to invalidate the credentials is to delete the service instance (you can create another, and it will have a fresh set of credentials). <!-- this advice should match on /docs/apps/continuous-deployment/ + /docs/services/cloud-gov-service-account/ + /docs/services/cloud-gov-identity-provider/ -->

These credentials can be used with the `cf login` command in automated deployment scripts.
