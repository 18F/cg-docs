cloud.gov has a [Provisional Authority to Operate (P-ATO) at the Moderate impact level from the FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board (JAB)](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#/product/18f-cloudgov).

Any federal agency can [leverage the cloud.gov P-ATO](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/faqs/how-does-an-agency-leverage-a-fedramp-authorization/) as part of the ATO for an agency system. If you're interested in this, you can request the cloud.gov P-ATO documentation package using the [FedRAMP Package Access Request Form](https://www.fedramp.gov/files/2015/03/FedRAMP-Package-Request-Form_V4_06192014.pdf).

The majority of federal systems are at the [Low and Moderate impact levels](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips199/FIPS-PUB-199-final.pdf#page=6); [cloud.gov can't yet host High impact systems](/overview/security/fisma-high-applications/).

We plan to publish much of the documentation from our P-ATO package, as part of our open source system documentation, after we process it and add context for public release.
