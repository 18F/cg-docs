For terminology that is used within the Platform as a Service at the heart of cloud.gov, start with [Cloud Foundryâ€™s glossary](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/glossary.html).

We will add additional terms if confusion about them comes up frequently in questions from partner agencies or the public.
