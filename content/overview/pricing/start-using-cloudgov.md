Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. This is placeholder copy. cloud.gov services can only be [purchased by federal government agencies through an Interagency Agreement (IAA)]({{< relref "overview/pricing/purchasing.md" >}}). We hope to provide services to state and local agencies in the future. ~~There are a number of different ways to start using cloud.gov.


## Try a limited-use sandbox account for free

A sandbox is a free, limited way to try cloud.gov so you can get a sense of how cloud.gov would work for the applications your team builds. Anyone with a U.S. federal government email address can sign up for a sandbox space on their own. [Learn more about sandboxes.]({{< relref "overview/pricing/free-limited-sandbox.md" >}})

## Work with an 18F team <— rewrite (isn't cloud.gov part of 18F?)

18F teams that are working with agency partners use cloud.gov to develop and deploy applications, and the cost of using cloud.gov is included in the Interagency Agreement (IAA) for the entire engagement. If you’re interested in full-service delivery of a product or application, [contact 18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/contact/). For example, [Every Kid in a Park](https://everykidinapark.gov/) (for the Department of the Interior) and [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/) (for the Department of Education) were both developed and launched using cloud.gov.

## Use cloud.gov as a vendor for a federal government client

cloud.gov can be a building block for vendors and contractors that supply services to federal agencies. If you’re part of a vendor or contractor, you can submit proposals to agencies for services to be built on top of cloud.gov.

If you’re part of a vendor or contractor that already works with government agencies and you’re interested in using cloud.gov, ask your agency partners to evaluate this option.
