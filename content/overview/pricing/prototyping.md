The prototyping package enables teams to build and deploy many experimental applications in the secure, compliant, and standardized cloud.gov environment.

## Flexible structure

A prototyping package can have an unlimited number of users (such as developers and program managers) and an unlimited number of separate application environments with a variety of applications. An entire agency, office, or department can purchase a prototyping package. A person or team at the agency (such as an IT services team) manages access to the package.

### Example use cases

- Enable teams to evaluate compatibility with cloud.gov for candidate systems before moving them to production on cloud.gov, including load testing.
- Give each technical team member their own cloud environment as a professional development opportunity, helping them train on modern technologies.
- Reduce shadow IT by giving staff an approved environment, with oversight, to try experiments and new ideas.

### Limitations

Prototyping packages cannot host production data. All prototyping package applications are limited to using the `*.app.cloud.gov` domain. Applications that are ready for production should move to a production package ([open data]({{< relref "overview/pricing/rates.md#open-data" >}}), [FISMA Low]({{< relref "overview/pricing/rates.md#fisma-low" >}}), or [FISMA Moderate]({{< relref "overview/pricing/rates.md#fisma-moderate" >}})).

## Full oversight and configuration for administrators

- Give and remove user access to individual environments. (This can include employees and contractors.)
- View all applications and all users with access to each environment.
- Set and adjust the resource usage limit for entire package, as well as setting and adjusting resource usage limits for each environment within the package.
- Integrate your agency identity provider with cloud.gov so that employees and contractors log in with agency credentials.
- Use the cloud.gov API to build tools for managing the prototyping package.

## Price

The annual access fee is $15K, with additional resource usage costs. See [packages and rates]({{< relref "overview/pricing/rates.md" >}}) for more information.
