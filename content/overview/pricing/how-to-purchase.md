cloud.gov services can only be purchased by government agencies. Currently, cloud.gov’s business is limited to federal agencies, though we hope to provide services to state and local agencies in the future.

## Federal teams

If you represent an agency that wants to use cloud.gov services, please contact us by filling out [our initial interest form] (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSevZfuJ_4KE-MZlm9gttYfsXQp0PJL7OR6k6LbZ9XnFn-oA6g/viewform). In a few days, we’ll contact you to schedule a followup conversation to discuss your team’s goals and needs, and how we can help.

cloud.gov services are sold through 18F, a federal digital consultancy housed within the [General Service Administration's Technology Transformation Service](https://www.gsa.gov/tts). 18F sells services to other agencies through the Interagency Agreement ("IAA") process. Currently, processing an IAA takes an average of 6-8 weeks (we are working to make this faster). If you would like to learn more about the IAA process and the information that you need to have ready to begin the process, please visit [18F's primer on IAAs] (https://pages.18f.gov/iaa-forms/primer.html).

## Vendor and contractor teams

cloud.gov can be a building block for vendors and contractors that supply services to federal agencies. If you’re part of a vendor or contractor, you can submit proposals to agencies for services to be built on top of cloud.gov.

If you’re part of a vendor or contractor that already works with government agencies and you’re interested in using cloud.gov, ask your agency partners to evaluate this option.
