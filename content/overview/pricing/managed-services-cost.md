Currently, we donâ€™t charge individually for [managed services]({{< relref "docs/apps/managed-services.md" >}}) (services that cloud.gov can spin up quickly and run on your behalf, such as databases, storage, and caching).

We plan to start charging for some of them in the future, to account for the resources they consume and our work to provide them. The pricing for each service will be different, and they will be severable.

We will ensure that users of these services are aware of the rates when they are set, and they will not be charged before then. Before we begin charging for these services, we will provide a way for the Org Manager to control or limit the costs of services used by their org.
