Currently, we donâ€™t charge individually for [managed services]({{< relref "docs/apps/managed-services.md" >}}) (services provided by cloud.gov that you can create on-demand for your application, such as databases, storage, and caching).

We plan to start charging for some of them in the future, to account for the resources they consume and our work to provide them. The pricing for each service will be different, and they will be severable.

When we begin charging for these services, that change will apply to new Inter-Agency Agreements. It won't apply to existing active agreements.

We will ensure that cloud.gov users are aware of the rates when they are set. Before we begin charging for these services, we will provide a way for the Org Manager to control or limit the costs of services used by their org.
