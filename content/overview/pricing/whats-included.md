All cloud.gov access packages include the following:

- API access, CLI access, Web UI access
- Documentation/tutorial material (including continuing development)
- Web-based support during business hours (platform available 24/7, problems addressed as-possible).
- Allocation of underlying IaaS (AWS) instances
- OS security updates and regular hardening of OS image
- Regular updates to platform security
- Network security
- ATO-ready documentation of system components (compliance-masonry form)
- Regular scanning for infrastructure-level vulnerabilities/misconfiguration
- Support for [these technologies](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/#system-buildpacks), through what are called "buildpacks".
    - All supported buildpacks receive regular security updates.
    - Note that [custom buildpacks]({{< relref "docs/apps/experimental/custom-buildpacks.md" >}}) can also be used.
- Self-service management of spaces and users within an organization
- Platform maintenance and managed service expansion overhead
- Support for customer-provided DNS for applications (including support for IPv6)

Note that the access package covers [both the AWS East/West and GovCloud environments]({{< relref "overview/pricing/rates.md#access-package" >}}), while that migration is in progress.
