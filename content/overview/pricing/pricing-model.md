cloud.gov is available to teams working on behalf of federal agencies. The pricing model is based on full cost recovery.

The current cloud.gov pricing model has two components: **access package** and **resource usage**. Find the current costs of a package that suits your needs on our [pricing page](/pricing/).

## Comparison with private sector pricing

Comparing cloud.gov’s pricing model to private Platform as a Service (PaaS) providers is difficult, as it is not an apples to apples comparison. A price comparison would include the up-front and opportunity costs of procurement, operations, security, and compliance teams in obtaining a solution. These costs can be difficult to isolate, especially if they are covered by various working capital funds in your agency.

cloud.gov avoids many of these costs and delivers a proven, ready-to-ATO infrastructure to your teams’ hands on day one via an Inter-agency Agreement (IAA). cloud.gov’s resource usage is already priced competitively with the private market, and is the superior option in reducing compliance friction to access the cloud.
