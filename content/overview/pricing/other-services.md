- TCO statement (red/not-included stuff)
-->

### Do agencies need a separate billing relationship with the IaaS provider?

No. However, they may want their own relationship if they want to use specific capabilities offered at the infrastructure-as-a-service level that are not exposed via cloud.gov.

### Does cloud.gov pricing include usage of New Relic or other external services?

No. For now, New Relic is passed through as a separate charge, invoiced every other quarter. Typical costs have been about $820 per project for six months, but on average costs are rapidly decreasing. We are also evaluating other non-3rd-party options.

### Does cloud.gov pricing include usage of S3 storage, or similar cloud storage?

Yes, S3 is available on-demand as a managed service with GSA volume discounts on usage charges.

If you have your own S3 storage credentials, you can make use of that storage from cloud.gov applications using Cloud Foundryâ€™s [user-provided service](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/user-provided.html) instances.
