cloud.gov services can only be purchased by federal government agencies through an IAA. We hope to provide services to state and local agencies in the future.

## Purchase cloud.gov for your federal team

If you represent an agency that wants to use cloud.gov services, you can purchase an access package. cloud.gov offers a number of packages, depending on your team’s needs. You can [compare packages and rates](/pricing/) to get a sense of the options. If you’re interested in a package for your team, contact us by emailing [cloud-gov-inquiries@gsa.gov](mailto:cloud-gov-inquiries@gsa.gov?body=What%27s%20your%20name%3F%0A%0AWhat%20agency%20or%20office%20do%20you%20work%20for%3F%0A%0AWhat%27s%20your%20job%20title%20or%20role%3F%0A%0ATell%20us%20a%20little%20about%20your%20project%20or%20your%20questions%20about%20cloud.gov:%0A%0AIf%20you%27d%20like%20us%20to%20call%20you%2C%20what%27s%20your%20phone%20number%20and%20when%20might%20be%20a%20good%20time%3F%0A). We’ll contact you to schedule a followup conversation to discuss your team’s goals and needs, and how we can help.

## Interagency Agreement (IAA)
cloud.gov services are sold through 18F, a federal digital consultancy housed within the [General Service Administration's Technology Transformation Service](https://www.gsa.gov/tts). 18F sells services to other agencies through the Interagency Agreement (“IAA”) process. Currently, processing an IAA takes an average of 6-8 weeks (we are working to make this faster).

To learn more about the IAA process and the information that you need to begin the process, please visit [18F's primer on IAAs] (https://pages.18f.gov/iaa-forms/primer.html).
