Anyone with a .gov, .mil, or .fed.us email address can try out cloud.gov for free by signing up for a sandbox account. No paperwork required.

## What is a sandbox?

A sandbox is a free, limited way to try cloud.gov. Sandboxes give you a [full access package]({{ <relref="/overview/pricing/whats-included.md" >}}) for a limited time. Your resource usage is capped at 1 GB of RAM per month, and the sandbox wonâ€™t serve production data. While paid accounts get access to a full range of managed services from cloud.gov, sandbox users can only use free services.

The sandbox experience is designed to give you a sense of how cloud.gov would work for the applications your team builds. Everything from the [setup process]({{ <relref="/docs/getting-started/setup.md"> }}) through deploying will work similarly to the way it works with a paid account.

If your experience with the sandbox is interesting, we would be glad to help you figure out whether a [paid account]({{ <relref="/overview/pricing/rates.md"> }}) is right for your team.

## Getting a sandbox

Email cloud-gov-inquiries@gsa.gov to request a free sandbox account (available to anyone with a .gov, .mil, or .fed.us email address). If you have other questions or comments for us, see [Contact]({{ <relref="/docs/help.md"> }}).
