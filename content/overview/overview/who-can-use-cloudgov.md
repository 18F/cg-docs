cloud.gov is suitable for hosting applications built on behalf of a U.S. government organization.

Customers pay for cloud.gov through the federal Interagency Agreement (IAA/MOU) process (see [how to purchase]({{< relref "start-using-cloudgov" >}})). *U.S. local, state, tribal, or territory government organizations are not able to use cloud.gov at this time.*
<!-- If this describes your team, [sign up for updates](/#updates) so that we can notify you if we add other options. -->
 
You should have a technical person or people (employees and/or contractors) available who will manage your applications on cloud.gov. They should be capable of [evaluating your application for suitability to cloud.gov]({{< relref "portfolio-analysis" >}}). They will need to be able to install the [cloud.gov command line interface]({{< relref "setup" >}}) (compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux) on their client workstation to interact with cloud.gov.
