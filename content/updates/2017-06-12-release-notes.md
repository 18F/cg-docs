<!--more-->

This week was light on releases you'll notice as a customer because we spent a lot of time updating and fixing things that will help us better serve you going forward.

### Fixed

- We finished migrating all tenants from East/West into GovCloud! Thank you to all our customers for their patience and cooperation in making this move successful.
- Updated tests, documentation and manual checks we perform to ensure we were ready to begin shutdown of the E/W environment.
- Clarified documentation about deployer accounts.

### Platform releases

- [Fixed IP addresses for communicating with external apps](https://cloud.gov/docs/apps/static-egress/#cloud-gov-egress-addresses): Our customers often want cloud.gov apps that can talk to the outside and we now have an enabler to make that happen in a more secure way. Outbound traffic from cloud.gov comes from specific IP addresses to help customers open up a connection between cloud.gov and something hosted elsewhere.

#### Additional upgrades

- [RootFS cflinuxfs2 1.129.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cflinuxfs2-rootfs-release/releases/tag/v1.129.0)
