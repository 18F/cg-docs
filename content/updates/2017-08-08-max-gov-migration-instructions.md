cloud.gov is migrating all users with native cloud.gov accounts (not users with an agency single sign on provider) to use OMB MAX for authentication to the platform. This page is a guide to what will change and how you can prepare for this transition.

## What’s changing?

Right now, there are two ways to log in to cloud.gov: either you use your agency’s credentials or a cloud.gov account. This change only affects users who have a cloud.gov account.

Soon, we will switch these users to use OMB MAX to log in to cloud.gov. **We will post future updates on timing at [https://cloud.gov/updates/](https://cloud.gov/updates/) and by email.** We’re making this change both to increase the compliance of cloud.gov with federal standards and law and to make managing your account easier for you and your agency.

## What does this mean for me?

**If you already use your agency’s single sign-on (SSO) to log in to cloud.gov:** There is nothing further you need to do. Currently agencies using SSO are EPA, GSA, and FDIC. These customers will continue to log in as usual.

**If you use a cloud.gov account and already have a MAX account:** Double check that you can log in successfully to MAX and have a Secure+ SMS 2-factor device paired with your account.

**If you use a cloud.gov account to log in and don’t have a MAX account:** You need to create a MAX account with a Secure+ 2-factor device. Once we switch, you’ll be required to use that account to login to cloud.gov and all associated services.

To create a MAX account:
1. Go to login.max.gov, if you see your agency's logo, click it and sign in with your agency credentials.
1. If you don't see you agency's logo, click the green Register Now button in the top right corner or your agency’s logo. Make sure to add a 2-factor device to your account.

### What about contractors?

Contractors with a federal agency email address (.gov or .mil) should be able to self-register just like federal employees. If there are contractors or others on your team without a government email address, you’ll need to [contact OMB MAX directly](https://max.gov/maxportal/home.action) to get accounts for them.

## Prepare for the switch

You can create your account anytime and it only takes a few minutes. We encourage you to do it soon so you're prepared when we do switch.

After the switch, you won’t be able to login with your cloud.gov account. If you don’t make a MAX account before then, your apps, orgs, and spaces will not go away but you won’t be able to login to either the dashboard or the CLI. Once you create a MAX account, you’ll regain access.

To recap what you need to do:

**If** **your agency has integrated SSO with cloud.gov:**

You’re all set!

**If your agency logo is on the MAX login screen:**

Click the logo and make sure you can log in to MAX with your agency credentials.

**If you already have a MAX account:**

1. Make sure you can log in to MAX with your credentials.
1. Add a 2-factor device if you haven’t done so already.

**If you don’t already have a MAX account:**

1. Create a MAX account and register with your PIV/CAC card if you have a card reader.
1. Add a 2-factor device.
1. Make sure you can log in to MAX.

**If you’re a contractor without a federal email address**

1. Ask your agency sponsor to contact OMB MAX about getting you an account
1. Follow any direction from your agency sponsor
1. Make sure you can log in to MAX

We appreciate your patience and cooperation as we work to implement MAX authentication with cloud.gov.

## What is OMB MAX?

OMB MAX is a governmentwide collaboration platform with an authentication system agencies can use to log in to other shared services. MAX.gov also enables using a PIV/CAC card to log in to web services.

Though we currently use multi-factor authentication for all cloud.gov accounts, switching to MAX accounts enables agencies which require PIV/CAC cards for login to use cloud.gov more easily. MAX also makes it easier for agencies to meet their own compliance requirements for users of cloud.gov by implementing single sign-on with agency services. For most users, this will provide a better user experience by not having a separate login and second factor to keep track of for cloud.gov.
