Curious what’s new that you might find helpful as a cloud.gov application developer? Here are highlights from our platform updates over the past two weeks.

### Fixed
- When a user of the web-based dashboard reaches the end of their activity log, the log no longer displays a “Show more” button. Previously this button implied there might be more content when there was not.
- Dashboard users with many organizations can now see all of the spaces and apps for which they are a member. Previously, on the overview page, some organizations would appear empty or with some spaces and apps missing.

### Security

cloud.gov is now included in the [18F vulnerability disclosure policy](https://18f.gsa.gov/vulnerability-disclosure-policy/), which gives guidelines for security researchers from the public.
