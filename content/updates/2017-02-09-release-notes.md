Curious what’s new that you might find helpful as a cloud.gov application developer? Here are highlights from our platform updates over the past two weeks.
<!--more-->

### Added
- The [cloud.gov status page](https://cloudgov.statuspage.io/), which uses another domain to publicly report the availability and performance of cloud.gov, now includes the availability of the new, FedRAMP Authorized AWS GovCloud environment. It also reports the availability of the legacy AWS East/West environment as some users’ systems have not yet been migrated.

### Fixed
- When a user reaches the end of their activity log, the log no longer displays a “Show more” button. Previously this button implied there might be more content when there was not.
- Users with administrative permissions can now see all of the spaces and apps they were administrators for on the overview page. Previously, only the most recent requests were providing data to this view.

### Security

cloud.gov is now included in the [18F vulnerability disclosure policy](https://18f.gsa.gov/vulnerability-disclosure-policy/). 18F wants security researchers to feel comfortable reporting vulnerabilities they’ve discovered in systems like cloud.gov. The policy sets out the parameters for that research, including how to send us reports and how long we ask researchers to wait before disclosing vulnerabilities.
