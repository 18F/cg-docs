title: "Starting now, Sandboxes expire after 90 days"

In our monthly update from November, we mentioned we would start expiring sandboxes after 90 days. Today, we're starting that clock. Here's what to expect.
 

* Any sandboxes applications you have right now will be deleted 90 days from today.
* The apps themselves will be deleted and any managed services attached to them will be disconnected.
* You will not lose your cloud.gov account.
* Starting five days before we delete your sandbox, we'll send you an email reminder every day unless you delete your sandbox yourself

If you have an application in your sandbox that you need to keep online for longer than 90 days, you should consider purchasing a paid cloud.gov account. Any prototyping or production account will allow you to host apps for any amount of time. Contact us to learn how to get started with a paid plan.
