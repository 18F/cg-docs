In our [monthly update from November]({{< relref "updates/2017-11-20-release-notes-buildpacks-volume-services-other-new-features.md" >}}), we mentioned we would start expiring [sandbox spaces]({{< relref "overview/pricing/free-limited-sandbox.md" >}}) after 90 days. Today, we're starting that clock. Here's what to expect.
 
* Any sandbox applications you have right now will be deleted 90 days from today, along with service instances, routes, etc., in the sandbox.
* You will not lose your cloud.gov account.
* You can start a new 90-day evaluation period just by creating a new app or service.
* Starting five days before we delete your sandbox, we'll send you an email reminder every day unless you delete your applications yourself.

We hope you find the sandbox helpful.

If you'd like to keep your sandbox applications online for longer than 90 days, you should consider purchasing a paid cloud.gov plan. [Any prototyping or production package]({{< relref "overview/pricing/rates.md" >}} will allow you to host apps for any amount of time.
