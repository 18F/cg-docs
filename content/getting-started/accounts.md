## Setting up your account

You will need a Cloud Foundry account before continuing. If you don't already have an account, please [create an issue in the DevOps issue tracker](https://github.com/18F/DevOps/issues/new) and assign it to [@dlapiduz](https://github.com/dlapiduz) or [@ozzyjohnson](https://github.com/ozzyjohnson).

## Resetting your password

Do you have a Cloud Foundry account, but don't know the password? Go to https://login.cloud.gov/forgot_password to reset it.
