## Setting up your account

You will need a Cloud Foundry account before continuing. To get an account:

* **If you are a member of 18F:** post in #cloud-gov-support.
* **If your organization/project is registered with cloud.gov:** ask one of your teammates to [send you an invite](https://login.cloud.gov/invitations/new).
* **Otherwise:** see [who can use cloud.gov]({{< relref "intro/overview/who-can-use-cloudgov.md" >}}).

## Resetting your password

Do you have a Cloud Foundry account, but don't know the password? Go to https://login.cloud.gov/forgot_password to reset it.
