## Setting up your account

You will need a Cloud Foundry account before continuing. To get an account:

* **If you are a member of 18F:** post in #cloud-gov-support.
* **If your organization/project is registered with cloud.gov:** ask one of your teammates to follow [these instructions]({{< relref "managing-teammates.md" >}}).
* **Otherwise:** see [who can use cloud.gov]({{< relref "intro/overview/who-can-use-cloudgov.md" >}}).

## Resetting your password

If you log into Cloud Foundry using your agency's account system, you can reset your password using your agency's normal process.

If you log in with a Cloud Foundry account that has its own password (including `ORGNAME_deployer` accounts), you can reset your password by going to https://login.cloud.gov/forgot_password.
