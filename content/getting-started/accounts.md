## Setting up your account

You will need a cloud.gov account before continuing. To get an account:

* **If you are a member of GSA or the EPA:** No account creation needed! You will be using single-sign-on (SSO). Ensure that you can log in at [login.cloud.gov](https://login.cloud.gov/) by clicking on your agency name.
* **If your organization/project is registered with cloud.gov:** ask one of your teammates to follow [these instructions]({{< relref "managing-teammates.md" >}}).
* **Otherwise:** see [who can use cloud.gov]({{< relref "intro/overview/who-can-use-cloudgov.md" >}}).

## Resetting your password

If you log into cloud.gov using your agency's account system, you can reset your password using your agency's normal process.

If you log in with a cloud.gov account that has its own password (including `ORGNAME_deployer` accounts), you can reset your password by going to https://login.cloud.gov/forgot_password.

## Using your account responsibly

Acceptable uses of cloud.gov include building and managing government digital services, making and trying test services to learn about how cloud.gov works, and activities contributing to the development of cloud.gov itself.

In order to help us keep cloud.gov secure, we require that you use your account appropriately. When you use cloud.gov, you agree that you will respect these rules of behavior:

- Conduct only authorized business on the system.
- Maintain the confidentiality of your authentication credentials; a cloud.gov operator should never ask you to reveal them. We recommend the user of a password manager and strong credentials whenever possible.
- Promptly logout when session access is no longer needed. Never leave your computer unattended while logged into cloud.gov.
- Report all security incidents or suspected incidents (e.g. improper or suspicious acts) related to cloud.gov systems and networks to [cloud.gov support](https://docs.cloud.gov/help).
- Safeguard system resources against waste, loss, abuse, unauthorized use or disclosure, and misappropriation.
- Do not process U.S. classified national security information on the system.
- Do not browse, search or reveal information hosted by cloud.gov except in accordance with that which is required to perform your legitimate tasks or assigned duties.
- Do not retrieve information, or in any other way disclose information, for someone who does not have authority to access that information.
- Do not intentionally use a client that makes use of obsolete or insecure encryption algorithms.
- Do not configure your browser to ignore security warnings which may involve your connection with cloud.gov; report warnings which you cannot explain to [cloud.gov support](https://docs.cloud.gov/help).
- If you believe you are being granted access that is more than necessary to perform your legitimate tasks or assigned duties, immediately [notify cloud.gov support](https://docs.cloud.gov/help).

Any person who obtains information from a computer connected to the Internet in violation of her employerâ€™s computer-use restrictions is in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

Access to systems and networks owned by cloud.gov is governed by, and subject to, all federal laws, including, but not limited to, the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, if the applicable cloud.gov system maintains individual Privacy Act information. Access to cloud.gov systems constitutes consent to the retrieval and disclosure of the information within the scope of your authorized access, subject to the Privacy Act, and applicable state and federal laws.

Contact [cloud.gov support](https://docs.cloud.gov/help) if you do not understand any of these rules.
